* Playground for learning magit
In Spacemacs, thus defaults to a different set of bindings
* First commit
** Must setup remotes
[[https://magit.vc/manual/magit/The-Two-Remotes.html][The two remotes]] will be prompted for at the first commit
Lets try to use the (apparently not well known) /push-remote/ feature
| Key     | Action                                  |
|---------+-----------------------------------------|
| SPC g s | git-status                              |
| ?       | (to get the help)                       |
|         | write the commit msg                    |
| C-c     | save the commit msg and continue        |
| SPC g s | git status                              |
| P       | Push                                    |
| p       | push-remote (first time sets the value) |
| u       | (upstream)  (first time sets the value) |
|         |                                         |
